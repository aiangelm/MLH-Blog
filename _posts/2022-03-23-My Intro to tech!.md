How did my journey into tech begin?

Over the years I have developed an ever-increasing interest in technology, starting from a young age
and playing on the family computer, to as I grew older building my own computer as a passion project.<br>
This brought me great joy and lead me to taking specialized courses in high school on the inter-working
of computers and how they operate and communicate. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and actually<br>
took an internship the following year to help teach the courses to underclassmen. This introduced me to an entirely new 
prospective in the field, as before I would focus on me and my understanding and now,<br> I was making my
priorities to work with my underclassmen and apply my knowledge and understanding for their benefit.
As my interests in the field evolved, I decided to pursue a job doing computer hardware<br> and software troubleshooting at a 
plastic surgery office. The tasks assigned to me ranged from every day troubleshooting I/O devices to discovering, documenting,
and solving driver and software conflicts. 
 
I first decided I wanted to work on receiving an associate degree in IT with an emphasis on computer networking. My course was a streamline
 course to prepare me for the working industry, and a CCNA certification.<br> This was done by exposing us to networking labs on a daily basis
 where we would troubleshoot and build working networks on Cisco routers and switches. The process itself was frustrating at time due to my mindset <br>
 of wanting perfection, but overall, I felt satisfied when I could diagnose the issues presented to us, or build a working simulation.
 
 After receiving my associates I had decided i wanted to work on a bachelors in IT due to the influence of one of my teachers, named jeremy during my time at community college.
 While working on my bachelorâ€™s degree in IT<br> and further delving into concepts behind networking I found myself doing a significant amount of groupwork and labs. From these 
 assignments I would find myself in a team leader position more often than not.<br> During these experiences I usually would end up spending extra time not related to the project 
 explaining concepts and helping my peers understand the course material. This gave me a rewarding experience as I got to see my<br> fellows succeed due to my efforts in teaching and 
 working with them on a personal level. From this I discovered I enjoyed the idea behind helping others succeed in their educational goals and it was very self-fulfilling for me.
 
 From this point I am personally undecided between graduating with my bachelors and working in the field doing Sys Admin, or pursuing my passion for helping others learn and finishing
 my masters in IT, to potentially<br> pursue a position teaching IT/networking to the upcoming generation of students.
