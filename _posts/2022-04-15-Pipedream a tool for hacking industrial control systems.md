Have you heard about the new versatile tool pipedream?

Pipedream is a new versatile malware tool, the US goverment warns, has been built for the sole purpose of targeting industrial
 control systems, like power grids, factories, water ultilities, and refineries with specific malware. on 4/13/2022, the 
 Department of Energy, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, NSA, and FBI released an advisory 
 about a new toolset  known as pipedream which is capable of meddling with a wide range of industrial control system equipment.
 
 The toolkit was designed with malware that contains an array of compnents designed to disrupt and control functioning devices, mostly targeting
 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that are sold by Schneider Electric and OMRON and are designed to serve as the interface between traditional 
 computers and the actuators and sensors in industrial environments. Another component of the malware is designed to target Open Platform Communications 
 Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers—the computers that communicate with those controllers.
 
 Sergio Caltagirone, who is the vice preseident of threat intellgence at the cyber security firm Dragos states, this toolset is "The most expansive
 industrial control system attack tool, that has ever been documented". Other officials at Schneider Electric stated that "the tool is like a Swiss Army 
 knife with a huge number of pieces to it.”
