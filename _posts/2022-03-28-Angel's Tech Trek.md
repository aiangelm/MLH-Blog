Why Did I Choose To Pursue the Tech Industry?

Graduating high school in 2018 I had no clue what I wanted to go to college for or even 
for my career in the future. <br> For the longest time, I actually wanted to be a flight attendant, but after doing more research, I realized that that path would not be the best option for me.<br> I then started researching other fields that were in demand and that I would be able to make a living from and that's how I stumbled on technology. 
<br>
<br>
As I started researching some of the roles and things involved in tech, I realized it would be a better fit for me because I like the flexibility and the challenges that come with it.<br> Flexibility is very important to me, with a career in tech I can work from home or anywhere in the world! I also want to be able to<br> take time for myself and to spend time with my family and friends. Being a continuous learner along with my personality,<br> I get bored of things easily and am always looking for something new every once in a while. With a career in tech I will never be bored.<br> I will be constantly challenged and be able to take my career wherever I am interested.

While at community college, I took my first programming class which was python and I enjoyed it.<br> The same time I was learning python I was also learning C++ which I did not enjoy at all. The only thing I was thinking about the whole<br>time I took the course was how much simpler it would be to use python.<br> I also don't recommend learning two new languages at the same time! Since both of those languages were my first,<br> I was very confused because I didn't understand the fundamentals yet. At my community college I also took an Information Business Systems Concepts<br>course at the school which I found interesting.

My dad served in the Marine Corps as Maintenance Data Specialist Chief. While he was still active duty he brought me to his place of work<br> so I could meet some of the people on his team which included developers, programmers, and system administrators.<br>If I knew then what I know now I would have been taking notes and exchanged contact information with the people I interacted with,<br>but it was still a great experience and really showed me what opportunities were out there for me. The day that I got to spend in the<br> office with my dad I was shadowing a woman on the team and she was the leader which I though was awesome to see in the workplace.

Graduating from Craven Community College with my Associates in Arts degree I knew what I wanted to major in and that was IT!<br> I transferred to Winston-Salem State University Fall 2020 and have been working on my Bachelors degree, which I am almost at the end of completing!
