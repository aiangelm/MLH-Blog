Why Did I Choose To Pursue the Tech Industry?

Graduating high school in 2018 I had no clue want I wanted to go to college for or even 
for my career in the future. For the longest time, I actually wanted to be a flight attendant, but after doing more research, I realized that that path would not be the best option for me. I then started researching other fields that were in demand and that I would be able to make a living from and that's how I stumbled on technology.

As I started researching some of the roles and things involved in tech, I thought that it would be a better fit for me because I like the flexibility and the challenges that come with it. Flexibility is very important to me, with a career in tech I can work from home or anywhere in the world! I also want to be able to take time for myself and to spend time with my family and friends. The way my personality is, I get bored of things easily. With a career in tech I will never be bored. I will be constantly challenged.

While at community college, I took my first programming class at which was python and I enjoyed it.
